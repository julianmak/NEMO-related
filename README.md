# NEMO-related

Personal homebrew collection of NEMO (> ver 3.6) related content.

Disclaimer!!! The codes and ESPEICALLY the Python codes for dealing with NEMO data are mostly adapted from pre-existing
tools (there should be documentation from "where"; if there isn't please let me know.) I don't claim to have done 
anything new/clever/efficient, so use at your own risk!

# To do:
- [ ] upload ldfeke (code, guide, technical notes) at some point
- [ ] upload NEMO compilation and technical notes
- [ ] upload python scripts / notebooks
- [ ] create/upload hacked (select?) CDFtool commands into Python

# key updates:
* 16 Mar 2018 -- opening of repository as a move to get me to actually do something...
