# NEMO-related

GitHub repository of me personal homebrew of NEMO (> ver 3.6) related content. 
[Click here](https://nemo-related.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for documentation of contents (may want to
right click and open in a new window).

***Disclaimer***!!! The Python codes for dealing with NEMO data are mostly adapted from pre-existing
tools (there should be documentation from "where"; if there isn't please let me know.) I don't claim to have done 
anything new/clever/efficient/100% correct, so use these at your own risk!

If you do see mistakes, please do contact me at julian.mak@physics.ox.ac.uk

# To do:
- [ ] upload ldfeke (code, guide, technical notes) at some point
- [ ] upload NEMO compilation and technical notes
- [ ] upload python scripts / notebooks
- [ ] create/upload hacked CDFtool commands into Python (probably only of the ones I actually use)

# key updates:
* 04 Jul 2018 -- added a Read The Docs document
* 08 Apr 2018 -- initial commit of a "pyCDFTOOLS" with sample Jupyter notebooks
* 16 Mar 2018 -- opening of repository as a move to get me to actually do something...
