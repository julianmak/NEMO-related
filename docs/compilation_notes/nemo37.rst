   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

NEMO 3.7(?) + XIOS 2.0
======================

(This is the version I first implemented GEOMETRIC in.)

System settings: ``gcc-4.9``, Ubuntu 16.04, ``bashrc`` as configured in the page
one level up.

The assumption here is that the compiler is fixed and the packages (e.g.,
NetCDF4 and a MPI bindings) are configured to be consistent with the compilers.
See :ref:`here <sec:other-pack>` to check whether the binaries exist, where they
are, and how they might be installed.

XIOS 2.0 (svn v1322)
--------------------

NEMO 4.0 (svn v8666)
--------------------
