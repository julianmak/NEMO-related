Julian's NEMO notes and codes
=============================

Homebrew collection of NEMO (:math:`\geq` v3.6) related content, existing here primarily to remind myself of code details. Includes compilation notes, analyses codes, and misc. other topics. Appropriate disclaimers in the individual sections themselves.

I can be contacted at jclmak@ust.hk regarding modifying / adding to the content here.

* If you are here for the GEOMETRIC codes that I maintain, try this `repository <https://github.com/julianmak/GEOMETRIC_code>`_.
