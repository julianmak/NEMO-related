Julian's NEMO notes and codes
=============================

Homebrew collection of NEMO (> ver 3.6) related content, mostly existing here
for reminding myself the details (of which there are many). Includes compilation
notes, analyses codes, and eventually some GEOMETRIC and its NEMO implementation
in here too. Appropriate disclaimers in the individual sections themselves.

I can be contacted at julian.mak@physics.ox.ac.uk regarding the modifying /
adding to the content here.
