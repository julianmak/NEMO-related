Julian's NEMO notes and codes
=============================

Homebrew collection of NEMO (mostly post v3.6) related content, existing here
primarily to remind myself of code details. Includes compilation notes, analyses
codes, and eventually details to some GEOMETRIC details, its NEMO implementation
and model building in here too. Appropriate disclaimers in the individual
sections themselves.

I can be contacted at julian.mak@physics.ox.ac.uk regarding the modifying /
adding to the content here.
