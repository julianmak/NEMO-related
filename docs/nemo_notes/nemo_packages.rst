   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Other NEMO packages
===================

Some useful tools that come with NEMO are available in the analog of the
``TOOLS`` folder. These are built using the ``ARCH`` files as you would for
building an experiment with e.g.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  ./maketools -n REBUILD_NEMO -m HKUST_HPC2

Notes on the ones I have used may be found here.
