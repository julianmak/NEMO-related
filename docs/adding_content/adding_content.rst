   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Misc. content
=============
   
This manual of sorts is generated using `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ in `reStructredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_, uploaded to `GitHub <https://github.com/julianmak>`_ and generated using `ReadTheDocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ The syntax for the relevant rst files I mostly took from the `MITgcm <https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ ReadTheDocs manual. Included here are some notes and terminal commands I used to get the underlying python things (which acts as backend for sphinx and the sample notebooks) working.

There is also a *singularity* page here for firedrake, because it doesn't really fit anywhere else...
