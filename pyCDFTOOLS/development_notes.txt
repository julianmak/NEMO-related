%%%%%%%%%%  General   %%%%%%%%%%

pyCDFTOOLS here is a hacked up python version of CDFTOOLS developed as part of 
the DRAKKAR project (their GitHub at https://github.com/meom-group/CDFTOOLS).
It only really works with NEMO data though the underlying algorithms are 
transferrable even if the code is not.

These codes are not necessarily faster / better / more accurate than CDFTOOLS,
it's just a personal preference of mine to not like doing analyses through
Fortran. It is likely also to be incomplete, as I will probably work on it from
a when-needs-arise basis.

The codes I/O are designed for data generated from NEMO 3.7/4.0 onwards. 
The older data will probably still work but you will need to either (i) create
a mesh_mask file, artificially or otherwise (NEMO/DOMAINcfg tool in the newer
NEMO and run it for one time step with nn_mask > 0, number doesn't matter
anymore), or (ii) artifically change the python files to read it the older
"mesh_hgr", "mesh_zgr" and "mask" files.

------  python things  ------

I got most things through "anaconda". The packages needed are

numpy
  -- I thought about using f2py at some point to wrap Fortran code into Python,
     but had compiler issues, and this got superseeded with numba/JIT

netCDF4 (NEMO data is mostly in netCDF4)
  -- some of the third party data (from NOC for example) is "masked", and it
     means in the data loading, ".data" may need to be added to pull out arrays
     that are not masked
numba
  -- jit(nopython = True) and similar compiles some routines as machine codes,
     which is mostly used in big loops (otherwise it is grindingly slow)

The notebooks use matplotlib, (for ORCA data) cartopy, iris, and some customised
modules

TO DO (updated 19 Aug 2018):

* Add TEOS10 for working out density in eos.py (get it off wherever Fabien put 
  it on the internet)
  -- test this with some sample data? Seems ok with gsw tests but the resulting
     neutral density looks a bit odd when working with NEMO data...?

* Fix some averagings in cdfmoc and cdfmocsig
  
* Rotation of vectors to deal with e.g. GYRE configuration

* Ice?
